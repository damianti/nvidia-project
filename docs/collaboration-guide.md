# Team Collaboration Guide

## üéØ Purpose

This guide outlines the collaborative process that teams must follow to successfully integrate their services into a cohesive cloud platform. **No pre-written docker-compose.yml exists** - teams must work together to create it.

Teams must agree on these error codes:
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Invalid input parameters
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Authentication required
- `FORBIDDEN`: Insufficient permissions

```http
GET /health
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "service-name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-10T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## üîß Environment Variables Agreement

### Required Environment Variables
Teams must agree on these standard environment variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db

# Message Queue
REDIS_URL=redis://host:port
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://user:pass@host:port

# Service Communication
LOAD_BALANCER_URL=http://load-balancer:port
ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://orchestrator:port
BILLING_URL=http://billing:port

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Service Ports
Teams must agree on these standard ports:

## üê≥ Docker Compose Collaboration

### Phase 1: Individual Docker Compose Files
Each team creates their own docker-compose.yml for development:

```yaml
# Example: team1-ui/docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  ui:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
```

### Phase 2: Integration Planning
Teams meet to plan the final docker-compose.yml:

#### Discussion Points:
1. **Service Dependencies**: Which services depend on which
2. **Network Configuration**: How services will communicate
3. **Volume Management**: Shared data and configuration
4. **Environment Variables**: Standardized configuration
5. **Health Checks**: Service health monitoring

### Phase 3: Final Docker Compose Creation
Teams work together to create the final docker-compose.yml:

#### Collaboration Process:
