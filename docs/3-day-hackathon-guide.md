## ‚ö° Rapid Development Tips

### Technology Stack Recommendations
**Choose technologies you're familiar with!**

#### Frontend (Team 1):
- **React.js** with Create React App (fastest setup)
- **Vue.js** with Vue CLI (alternative)
- **Bootstrap/Tailwind** for quick styling

#### Backend (Teams 2, 3, 6, 7):
- **Node.js** with Express (fastest for APIs)
- **Python** with FastAPI (good for data processing)
- **Go** with Gin (high performance)

#### Database:
- **SQLite** for development (no setup required)
- **PostgreSQL** for production (if time allows)

### Quick Setup Commands

#### React.js (Team 1):
```bash
npx create-react-app team1-ui
cd team1-ui
npm start
```

#### Node.js API (Teams 2, 6, 7):
```bash
mkdir team2-load-balancer
cd team2-load-balancer
npm init -y
npm install express cors helmet
```

#### Python API (Team 3):
```bash
mkdir team3-orchestrator
cd team3-orchestrator
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

### Docker Quick Start
```bash
# Create Dockerfile
echo 'FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]' > Dockerfile

# Create docker-compose.yml
echo 'version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"' > docker-compose.yml
```

## ü§ù Rapid Integration Strategy

### Day 1: API Design Agreement
**Must be completed by end of Day 1!**

#### Standard API Response Format:
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": object | null,
  "error": {
    "code": string,
    "message": string
  } | null,
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
}
```

#### Required Endpoints for Each Service:
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/status` - Service status
- `POST /api/test` - Test endpoint

### Day 2: Quick Integration
**Focus on getting services talking to each other!**

#### Integration Steps:
1. **Morning**: Agree on service URLs and ports
2. **Afternoon**: Implement basic communication
3. **Evening**: Test integration

#### Quick Integration Test:
```bash
# Test service communication
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:3002/health
curl http://localhost:3003/health
```

### Day 3: Final Integration
**Create the final docker-compose.yml together!**

#### Final Integration Steps:
1. **Morning**: Merge all individual docker-compose files
2. **Afternoon**: Test complete system
3. **Evening**: Prepare presentation

## üìä Presentation Requirements

2. Uploads a Docker image
3. Configures resources
4. Deploys container
5. Shows container running

## üö® Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Port Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple services using same port
**Quick Fix**: Use different ports for development
```yaml
# Team 1: 3001, Team 2: 3002, Team 3: 3003, etc.
```

### Network Issues
**Problem**: Services can't communicate
**Quick Fix**: Use host networking or external networks
```yaml
networks:
  - host
```

### Environment Variables
**Problem**: Different variable names
**Quick Fix**: Standardize early
```bash
# Agree on these Day 1:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
REDIS_URL=redis://host:port
```

### Integration Problems
**Problem**: Services don't integrate
**Quick Fix**: Use simple HTTP calls first
```javascript
// Start with simple HTTP requests
fetch('http://other-service:port/health')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
