# NOTE: The containers are created inside docker-dind, which has its own network context.
        # The nvidia-network exists on the Docker Compose host, not inside docker-dind.
        # Therefore, we cannot connect the containers directly to nvidia-network from here.
        # Solution: Create the container WITHOUT specifying a network, and then expose port 80.
        # The container will be accessible from docker-dind using the exposed port.
