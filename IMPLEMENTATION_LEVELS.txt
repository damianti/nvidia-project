NOTES
================================================================================

This implementation guide should be used as a roadmap for the ScaleUp-Nvidia
project. Teams should focus on their critical path items first, ensuring
basic functionality works before adding advanced features.

The system is designed to be a lightweight alternative to Kubernetes,
focusing on simplicity and cost-effectiveness while maintaining enterprise-
grade reliability and performance.

Remember: Start simple, test thoroughly, and iterate based on user feedback
and performance metrics.
